The Cuarto Dorado tends to be dated as being from the 14th century. It is especially associated with the reign of Sultan Muhammad V, as some of its inscriptions make specific reference to him. Its name comes from the gold colour that characterised the polychrome ceiling of the main room and some of its corridors from after the Christian conquest.
