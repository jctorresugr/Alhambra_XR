This wall follows the pattern that had been planned by the architect Francisco Prieto Moreno and drawn in the drawing by Fernando López Díaz de la Guardia from 1968, but the central line was supposed to be purple and should have followed the same purple hue (it's a bug in the manufacture or a subsequent restitution).  The image shows the drawings and layout plan of the ceramic dadoes on the south, east and west walls of the Cuarto Dorado done by Fernando López Díaz de la Guardia in February 1968.
